				Elevate DevWorks began as a small passion project by{" "}
				<strong>Chris Owens</strong>, a developer who saw how often
				great designs were held back by unreliable or overly complex
				development. After years of working with enterprise systems,
				Chris set out to bring that same level of precision and quality
				to smaller teams, without the layers of red tape.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4">
				What started as weekend projects soon grew into a development
				studio focused on{" "}
				<strong>partnership, craftsmanship, and trust</strong>. Today,
				we collaborate with business owners and designers who want
				reliable, modern websites that actually deliver results.
